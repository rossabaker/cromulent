      <description>I am a lifelong Midwesterner. Fight songs are a big deal in the Big Ten. I played the &amp;ldquo;Minnesota Rouser&amp;rdquo; in my high school band in Illinois. &amp;ldquo;Indiana Our Indiana&amp;rdquo; is objectively the best, as measured by the fact I have two degrees from there and zero degrees from anywhere else.&#xA;The conference isn&amp;rsquo;t as Midwestern as it used to be, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have the 9 10 11 13 17 other songs gathered to sing along with whenever someone scores on Purdue.</description>
