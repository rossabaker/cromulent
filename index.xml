Builds require local runners,&#xA;typically containers.  Here, we create minimalistic containers geared&#xA;toward running Nix builds, so projects supply their logic and Actions&#xA;provides the compute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In the Avian Period of social media, we had a late December tradition of enumerating the coding languages we used over the last year. Some people would aggregate them into a language ranking, which I never cared for. However, I thought they were great as a recommendation engine while browing specific developers.&#xA;Without further ado, my #code2023.&#xA;Languages used in 2023 # Awk Part of the old fart&amp;rsquo;s command line toolbox.</description>

      <description>Libravatar is a decentralized alternative to Gravatar for displaying a profile picture. There are several implementations, but self-hosting can be as simple as a couple DNS records and a small Nginx configuration.&#xA;Deriving the images in advance # Avatar images can be prepared in advance. For any high-res image source, we need to accomplish three things:&#xA;Scale the image. The maximum size is 128x128. This is done with ImageMagick.

      <description>I would love to self-host Email, but the oligopoly has won. I switched to Pobox when my forwarder became insufficient.

      <description>The services hosted at rossabaker.com require multiple DNS entries.

However, I don&amp;rsquo;t meet their requirements for API access. This was a frustrating discovery after getting their sandbox working, but I digress.</description>

      <description>Running PostgreSQL on Darwin is not as smooth an experience as the NixOS module:&#xA;The nix-darwin module doesn&amp;rsquo;t create a dedicated postgres system user. Everything runs as the local user. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t create the data directory. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t set up the logs. The initdb call doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out of the box. It creates a postgres superuser, but because it&amp;rsquo;s peer authenticated and there&amp;rsquo;s no postgres system user. We fix all of those here.</description>

      <description>On the IndieWeb, we are taught to focus on our own itches. In Org Mode, we have TODO items. They&amp;rsquo;re two sides of the same coin, and either seems more fun than struggling with JIRA.&#xA;These are not yet prioritized.&#xA;TODO Improve typography. # I foolishly started from scratch.&#xA;TODO Finish descriptions on all my pages. # TODO Post my Twitter and Facebook archives. # TODO Automate synchronization of notes. # TODO Clean up tags # Particularly coming out of the social media archives.</description>

      <description>I have dabbled with Python for years, but have little production experience. I am used to not knowing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but the feeling is stronger in this module.&#xA;Package management # I am fighting hard to use Nix to manage my Python packages, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for a side quest while I&amp;rsquo;m getting comfortable with the language.&#xA;Micromamba # Micromamba is an alternative to Anaconda and Miniconda, neither of which installs cleanly on my Mac.</description>

      <description>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at all. I have tabled this effort for now in grudging favor of Micromamba.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m reading Modern Time Series Forecasting with Python. The first thing it asks me to do is install Conda, but package managers other than Nix give me a rash. I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to replicate its anaconda env to a devshell. Try it out like this:&#xA;MIT&#xA;nix develop git+https://git.rossabaker.com/ross/cromulent#modernTs This shell will only work with nixpkgs.</description>

      <description>Long ago, I stumbled across HyperTerminal on the family Windows 95 machine. I figured out how to dial into my mom-and-pop ISP with that, and had my first shell access on a multi-user machine. Magical. A friendly admin taught me a lot, including how to make a .plan on one of the great social networks of the day, Finger.&#xA;I can be fingered once again on Happy Net Box. Run this from your own shell:</description>

      <description>In Extreme Programming, we picked a new pair programmer every day. I decided that was nonsense, and adopted Pete. We paired for the next nineteen years. He preferred the title &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;principal staff,&amp;quot; but he shared his opinions whether you wanted them or not. He logged off this morning. Rest easy, friend.&#xA;P.S., this is what he thought of YAML.&#xA;#TuxedoCat #RIP</description>

      <description>Season finale tournament. We opened our three team group tonight, where just one advances. We threatened multiple times, but conceded a fluke goal. With 15 minutes to equalize, lightning cut short a 0-1 loss. Our league gives a fourth point for shutouts (WTF?), so now we must keep a clean sheet for any chance at the final. The math is brutal, but the team is inspiring, and I will miss them when it&amp;#39;s over.</description>

      <description>Dependabot finds things we don&amp;#39;t, but vulnerability fatigue is real. We have a telemetry client that uses OkHttp. We don&amp;#39;t write Kotlin, we don&amp;#39;t use our telemetry client in a way that invokes Kotlin, and our client probably doesn&amp;#39;t use the vulnerable parts of Kotlin. But every Scala repo will be pinged about every Kotlin stdlib vulnerability because it&amp;#39;s dormant on the classpath.&#xA;#Security #Dependabot</description>

      <description>A quick article on building your Scala vocabulary by understanding common affixes. &amp;quot;bi-&amp;quot; is intuitive, but what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;co-&amp;quot;? What are all those cryptic &amp;quot;-T&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-K&amp;quot;, and underscore suffixes? Familiarity with these can help us find the function we&amp;#39;re looking for, and name the ones we write so they can be found.&#xA;https://rossabaker.com/blog/scala-affixes/&#xA;#Scala</description>

      <description>A powerful way to build one&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary is to study prefixes and suffixes. In elementary school, we learn that bi- means two. We can see it in common words like bicycle and bilingual. As we progress through school into binomials and bivalence, we&amp;rsquo;re ready. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect: is biennial twice a year or once every two years? Biryani isn&amp;rsquo;t two helpings of ryani. Still, they are surely worth studying.&#xA;A colleague in our Scala study group asked, &amp;ldquo;Can we do the same with Scala?</description>

      <description>Spending a few hours of my Sunday gathering tax forms to send to a CPA, whom I&amp;#39;ll pay a few hundred dollars to reassemble information the government mostly already has. &amp;quot;Taxation is theft&amp;quot; is silly, but the calculations sure feel like a heist.&#xA;#Taxes</description>

      <description>Tonight the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra performed Pavel Haas&amp;#39; unfinished symphony in its North American premier. It was unfinished because the composer was murdered in Auschwitz. Some premieres are moving, and some premieres are obscure for a reason. This was moving, and I hope it&amp;#39;s heard in your city someday.&#xA;#IndySymphony #Indianapolis #ClassicalMusic</description>

      <description>The Geek Feminism Wiki&amp;#39;s conference anti-harassment policy¹ has been an excellent starting point for years, but hasn&amp;#39;t been refreshed for the Covid-19 Era. As mandatory precautions subside, those who continue additional voluntary precautions are often subjected to &amp;quot;mask shaming.&amp;quot; Does this rise to a level of being called out in a Code of Conduct in 2023? Which events are doing a good job in this stage of the pandemic?&#xA;¹ https://geekfeminism.</description>

      <description>Need to add one line to kid&amp;#39;s soccer league site that we are in Indiana, and all you Ohioans need to s/.com/.org/.&#xA;The custom theme from 2020 is too old for modern Hugo. Ugh. I pinned it with Nix, but that old nixpkgs doesn&amp;#39;t work on Apple Silicon. Upgrading the theme is a beast. Everything is terrible.&#xA;But change a version and a couple hashes, and I quickly rebuilt the precise old Hugo from source, which is now cached.</description>

      <description>The concept of &amp;quot;monadic profunctors&amp;quot;¹ for codecs is beautiful:&#xA;```&#xA;data Codec r w c a = Codec&#xA;{ codecIn :: r a,&#xA;codecOut :: c → w a&#xA;}&#xA;```&#xA;A parser `r a` may have expensive optimizations in its functor ops (run once) and then fast on each parse. Printer `w a` may be the same, but depends on input `c`, and must be recreated on each run.</description>

      <title>Ox. Hugo. Why not both?</title>

      <description>This site is built on a static site generator (SSG). They are a dime a dozen. I chose a less mainstream one, ox-hugo. After recently questioning that choice, I have new clarity on why it&amp;rsquo;s right for me.&#xA;The goal # I want to write and sometimes generate content in a markup language. The SSG generator should apply a template, create aggregate views (such as tags), and output a directory that can be served off a cloud CDN, self-hosted with open source like nginx, or even out of a local directory with a simple Rust binary.</description>

      <description>Matrix is a decentralized communication protocol. It is capable of many things, but I primarily use it for public chats on Open Source projects or private, end-to-end encrypted messaging.&#xA;Self-hosting # I am hosting Matrix on my dedicated Hetzner server. Requirements will vary by usage, but my Synapse server, a Python process, currently consumes about 350MB of RAM. Add on PostgreSQL and a reverse Nginx proxy, either of which might be shared with other services.</description>

      <description>An important Indieweb principle is to own your data. I tooted on mastodon.social sporadically for five years. The service is public, the protocol open, and the implementation open source. Still, it exists at the pleasure of its admins, with whom I have no contract.&#xA;After moving to another instance, I wanted to preserve my old content. We will use a technique called PESOS, or Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate to Own Site.</description>

      <description>Web Key Directory (WKD) is a standard to map email addresses to PGP public keys over HTTPS. In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll configure WKD for our domain.&#xA;Motivation # Independence # Public keys are traditionally submitted to one or more public key servers. Some, like pgp.mit.edu, are federated1. Others, like keys.openpgp.org, are not2. In neither case can I control whether they&amp;rsquo;re here tomorrow.&#xA;Consistent with Indieweb principles, WKD lets us self-host our identity.</description>

      <description>First impressions of #cohost :&#xA;Positive: Delightfully ungamified. I can&amp;#39;t see my own follower count. I don&amp;#39;t see heart counts on anyone&amp;#39;s posts. The incentives are good there.&#xA;Negative: I&amp;#39;m still an #foss hippie at heart. I&amp;#39;m skeptical how federation scales, I&amp;#39;m unlikely to ever hack on Mastodon source, I don&amp;#39;t know my operators here ... but what&amp;#39;s to stop another disastrous sale there?</description>

      <description>&lt;aside&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother recently passed away.  A lightly edited version of&#xA;this was read at her memorial service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/aside&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grandma and I had a tradition of playing Scrabble.  We used her&#xA;vintage set.  It still had score pads with games featuring players&#xA;further up the family tree.  It was intimidating.  I feared I might&#xA;draw a &amp;ldquo;þ&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;æ&amp;rdquo;, just like Chaucer used to play.  But it was indeed&#xA;the Modern English Alphabet Edition.  True to her meticulous nature,&#xA;it retained all its original pieces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taxonomy terms (e.g., &lt;code&gt;/categories/tech&lt;/code&gt;) are rendered in a simple&#xA;template that lists the article summaries in reverse order of modification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the taxonomy list page, which is rendered as a tag cloud.  We&#xA;use it for categories and tags.  Terms are rendered in a font&#xA;proportional to the logarithm of its page count.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most pages on the site are &amp;ldquo;single pages&amp;rdquo;.  These are generally the&#xA;subtrees in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.rossabaker.com/ross/cromulent/src/branch/main/src/org/cromulent.org&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code&gt;EXPORT_FILE_NAME&lt;/code&gt; not equal to &lt;code&gt;_index&lt;/code&gt;.&#xA;Think of them as the articles.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our header is straightforward semantic HTML, with a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&#xA;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.  It establishes the brand, and my brand is to be a&#xA;complete dweeb.  Therefore, we&amp;rsquo;re going to abuse CSS to render it as&#xA;an Emacs Lisp definition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The footer is a simple &lt;a href=&#34;http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard&#34;&gt;hCard&lt;/a&gt; with our name, pronouns, and socials.&#xA;Our social links will use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me&#34;&gt;rel-me microformat&lt;/a&gt; for verification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This template defines our default &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, and is not often&#xA;customized.  Most of it originated in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/hugo-mwe/hugo-mwe&#34;&gt;hugo-mwe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nothing here is extraordinary.  It is a simple&#xA;foundation for semantic HTML.  It specifies four blocks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rossabaker.com/configs/website/templates/head/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rossabaker.com/configs/website/templates/header/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;header&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rossabaker.com/configs/website/templates/footer/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;footer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugo can be configured with either TOML or YAML.  I spent my weirdness&#xA;budget on a literate config, so let&amp;rsquo;s stick to the default.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Default browser renderings have converged in a way that mostly obsoletes the venerable resets of yore. Consistency does not imply optimality. There is room to improve the defaults without relying on classes or HTML structures particular to any project. The rules here are implemented on rossabaker.com, but could be exported to start new projects.&#xA;Variables # Some values in this reconditioning are configurable, and will be defined as :root: variables with a --cromulent- prefix.</description>

      <description>I run an Ambient Weather WS-1400-IP weather station in the Castleton neighborhood of Indianapolis and share its public dashboard. The anemometer is not raised high enough for accuracy, but the rest is reasonably accurate.&#xA;I learned on 2022-09-06 that the Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport is now publishing METAR data. That airport is just a mile away, and certainly has a more credible weather station, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to compare to mine.</description>

      <title>Configuring Git for literate programming</title>

      <description>My personal Git repository, Cromulent, contains the source for various projects, such as configurations and the contents of this website.&#xA;Due to literate programming, much of the source code &amp;ldquo;weaves&amp;rdquo; code and documentation in Org. Most tools aren&amp;rsquo;t Org interpreters, so the Org must be &amp;ldquo;tangled&amp;rdquo; 1 back into separate files for general consumption. This process requires a bit of extra care around Git.&#xA;Three types of files # Original sources # Original sources are the minimal set of files that can&amp;rsquo;t be derived from other sources as part of the build process.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#39;t talk about the monoids or the sportsballs without boring the other half of my following, so I reply far more than I tweet. But separate accounts means no serendipitously stumbling across other shared interests. Twitter offers no good solution. Mastodon&amp;#39;s improvement is that my tale of woe fits into one toot.</description>
