I run an [[https://ambientweather.net/][Ambient Weather]] WS-1400-IP weather station in the Castleton
neighborhood of Indianapolis and share its [[https://ambientweather.net/devices/public/b78b5bb0e59646a78a623a940937335c][public dashboard]].  The
anemometer is not raised high enough for accuracy, but the rest is
reasonably accurate.

I learned on 2022-09-06 that the [[https://www.ind.com/business/general-aviation-airports/metropolitan-airport][Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport]] is
now [[https://aviationweather.gov/metar/data?ids=kump&format=decoded&hours=24&taf=off&layout=on][publishing METAR data]].  That airport is just a mile away, and
certainly has a more credible weather station, but it's fun to compare
to mine.
