_Scalatra in Action_ covers the Scalatra framework in its entirety,
starting with concepts such as request routing, input handling,
actions, and HTTP responses. For readers who don't already know Scala,
the book introduces the Scala language and sbt, the Simple Build
Tool. You'll learn how to use Scalatra's powerful templating engine,
Scalate. It also covers advanced topics such as data access, handling
heavy load, asynchronicity, securing your application, designing
RESTful APIs, and real-time web programming.
