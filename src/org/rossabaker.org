*Ross A. Baker* (/​ɹɔs eɪ beɪ.kɚ/) is an American software engineer who
is not notable enough for a Wikipedia article.  He's arguably not even
notable enough for this article on an eponymous domain.

#+toc: headlines 2

** Early life

Baker grew up in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Lake,_Illinois][Crystal Lake]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois][Illinois]].  He was gifted a copy of
[[https://archive.org/details/LearningBasicForTandyComputers][Learning BASIC for Tandy Computers]] by his aunt, and would enter and
then modify programs out of the back of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-2-1_Contact#Magazine][3-2-1 Contact Magazine]].  He
wanted to be a computer programmer or a Major League Baseball player,
but showed some aptitude for the former and absolutely none for the
latter.

In high school, he reverse engineered the roster format of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky_Hockey_2][Wayne
Gretzky Hockey 2]] and made a league simulator with rosters, drafts,
trades, and playoffs, in BASIC, and shared it with friends.  He hasn't
written anything that cool since.

** Education

Baker studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science at [[https://www.indiana.edu/][Indiana
University]], where he was recognized on campus as the guy who wore
shorts even in the dead of winter.  He captained the [[http://www.collegebowl.com/schoolhistoryrpt.asp?CustomerID=165][IU College Bowl
Team]] team to an abysmal [[http://www.collegebowl.com/schoolhistoryrpt.asp?CustomerID=165][2-13 record]] at the 1998 National Championship.

** Career

Baker has worked as a software engineer on school library circulation
systems, commercial insurance, mail-order music clubs, automobile
auctions, 340B compliance, cybersecurity, IP television, rewards
clubs, cloud infrastructure, and fintech.  He currently works as a
staff engineer with a heavy emphasis on mentoring.

He taught himself Scala and got deeply involved in Open Source and the
[[https://typelevel.org/][Typelevel]] ecosystem, where he serves on the Steering Committee.

Baker enjoys statistics, pairwise comparison, and various types of
sportsball.  He combined these interests to assist with the [[http://prwolfe.bol.ucla.edu/cfootball/][Wolfe
Ratings]] used by the Bowl Championship Series from 2001-2013.

** Controversies

*** 2005 World Series conspiracy theory

Baker believes, without evidence, that the 2005 World Series was
canceled due to lack of interest.  Some thought he'd let it go after
the Cubs won in 2016, but no.

** Personal life

Baker lives in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis][Indianapolis]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana][Indiana]], with his wife, two children, two
dogs, cat, myriad freshwater fish, frogs, and invertebrates.  He
is a volunteer soccer coach at [[https://northsidesoccer.com/][Northside Soccer]] and active member of
[[https://northchurchindy.com/][North United Methodist Church]].  He cross-country skis when it's snowy
and jogs when it's not.

My [[https://github.com/rossabaker/cromulent][personal Git repository]] hosts my configurations and this web site.
Most of it is sourced from a single [[https://github.com/rossabaker/cromulent/blob/main/src/org/rossabaker.org][Org Mode file]], but most tools
don't read Org directly.  We need to commit some [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][tangled]] sources to
interoperate with various tools.  We must deal with three sorts of
files.
#+hugo:more

*** Original sources

This is the minimal set of files from which all other files can be
derived.  As much as possible, we keep them in ~src~.

*** Ephemeral files

Ephemeral files can be tangled on demand and disposed of at will.
Development processes may need them, but they can be comfortably
recreated from the original sources.  An example of these are the Hugo
outputs when [[*Local Nix build][locally building the site]].

We put as many of them as we can in ~tmp~ for organization.  The best
way to handle them is with a [[https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore][gitignore]].

#+begin_src gitignore :tangle ../../.gitignore
  /tmp/
#+end_src

Nix builds create a ~result~ symlink by default that should laso be
ignored.

#+begin_src gitignore :tangle ../../.gitignore
  /result
#+end_src

*** Commited, generated sources

There are files that are neither original, nor can they be generated
on demand from originals.  This class of files is generally to be
avoided, but with the right mitigations, we can live with it and still
live in our Org Mode bubble within a world that isn't ready for it.

**** Location

Some files must be tangled to specific locations in the repository to
be loaded by other tools.  For example, Git looks for ~.gitignore~ and
in the project root.

Other files need to be tangled for non-Org tooling, but are imported
by something else.  The [[*Build website with Nix][Nix package for our website]], included in
~flake.nix~.  We stow all such files we can in the ~gen~ directory.

**** Problems and mitigations

***** Desycnhronization

The tangled source may be desynchronized with the Org Mode source.  We
could check for this with a GitHub workflow, but don't yet.

***** Bloated diffs

When we commit tangled sources, each hunk of the diff may be
duplicated between the original source and the tangled source.  This
is distracting in review.  We can set a gitattribute of [[https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_diff][~-diff~]], which
treats the specified file as binary.  It's a little white lie, but
it prevents repeating each hunk.

A second problem is that a larger diff has a larger surface area for
merge conflicts.  [[https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_merge][~-merge~]] avoids 3-way merges, but still flags the
file as a conflict.  Typically the file needs to be regenerated
in these cases.

Finally, seeting [[https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/97bc889ce840208652bf09b45f3b7859de43fe8e/docs/overrides.md#generated-code][~linguist-generated~]] suppresses these files from
rendered diffs.  It also excludes them from GitHub language stats.

We set all these gitattributes for all tangled sources.  The
~.gitattributes~ file itself gets gitattributes set on it!

#+begin_src gitattributes :tangle ../../.gitattributes
  gen/**          -diff -merge linguist-generated=true
  .gitignore      -diff -merge linguist-generated=true
  .gitattributes  -diff -merge linguist-generated=true
  flake.nix       -diff -merge linguist-generated=true

A Hugo site can be configured with either TOML or YAML.  I spent my
weirdness budget on a literate config, so let's stick to the default.
#+hugo:more
#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/config.toml
  baseURL = 'https://rossabaker.com'
  languageCode = 'en-us'
  title = 'Ross A. Baker'
#+end_src

**** hugo-mwe

This site is bootstrapped from [[https://gitlab.com/hugo-mwe/hugo-mwe][Hugo MWE]].  A [[https://scripter.co/hugo-modules-importing-a-theme/][hugo module]] would be
easier, but I have not figured out a way to integrate Hugo modules
with [[https://github.com/tweag/gomod2nix][gomod2nix]].  Instead, we'll do it the old-fashioned way and clone
it into ~src/hugo/themes~.

~themesDir~ cannot be a module mount.

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/config.toml
  theme = 'hugo-mwe'
  themesDir = 'src/hugo/themes'
#+end_src

Further design comes from the [[*CSS foundation][CSS foundation]].

**** Mounts

Because all this org stuff mucks with the [[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/#readout][normal directory structure]],
we have to give Hugo a few extra hints.  [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6457#issuecomment-546580193][~assetDir~ is "legacy"]], so
we'll use [[https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-config-mounts][module mounts]].

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/config.toml
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'tmp/hugo/layouts'
    target = 'layouts'
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'tmp/hugo/content'
    target = 'content'
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'src/hugo/content'
    target = 'content'
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'tmp/hugo/assets'
    target = 'assets'
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'src/hugo/assets'
    target = 'assets'
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'src/hugo/static'
    target = 'static'
  [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'tmp/hugo/static'
    target = 'static'
#+end_src

**** General site parameters

The ~css~ parameter lets us add custom stylesheets to the asset
pipeline.

- [[https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/][sanitize.css]] is a CSS library, licensed [[https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/][CC0 1.0]].  It provides:
  - ~sanitize.css~ is a basic reset
  - ~assets.css~ is constraints some widths to 100%
- ~chroma.css~ is [[*Syntax highlighting][generated below]].

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/config.toml
  [Params]
    css = [ 'sanitize.css', 'assets.css', 'cromulent.css', 'chroma.css', 'noto-fonts.css', 'fork-awesome.css', 'ox-hugo.css' ]
    description = "A perfectly cromulent developer."
    username = 'rossabaker'

    [Params.source]
      url = "https://github.com/rossabaker/cromulent"
#+end_src

**** ox-hugo

ox-hugo [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/goldmark/#enable-unsafe-html][recommends Goldmark]].  The ~unsafe~ is not as bad as it sounds:

#+begin_quote
While that setting sounds scary, all that does is allow have inline
HTML in your Markdown, as CommonMark allows!
#+end_quote

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/config.toml
  [markup.goldmark.renderer]
    unsafe = true
#+end_src

**** Syntax highlighting

The classless style is classless.

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/config.toml
  [markup.highlight]
    noClasses = false
#+end_src

Generate the ~chroma.css~ file.

#+name: chroma-css

this template so less gets repeated in the section overrides.  I'm
still missing something.

Talks get their own single-page template based on custom front matter.
#+hugo:more

- ~.Venue~ :: Where the talk was delivered.  Supports markdown.  Protip:
  put it in quotes if it begins with a link.
- ~.Source~ :: The source repository associated with the talk.
- ~.Slides~ :: If it's a =*.pdf=, it's rendered as an ~<object>~.
  Otherwise, put it in an ~<iframe>~.  Make sure it links to content
  served over https, or it won't load.

Metadata appears in the article header.

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: terms
:END:

This is the taxonomy list page, which is rendered as a tag cloud.  We
use it for categories and tags.  Terms are rendered in a font
proportional to the logarithm of its page count.
#+hugo:more

The least-used term is assigned an importance between =0=.  The most
used term is assigned an importance of =6=.  Everything else falls in
between.  We choose a logarithm because we expect the distribution to
roughly follow a power law.

#+begin_src html :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/layouts/_default/terms.html
  {{ define "main" }}
      <h1>{{ .Name }}</h1>
      <ul class="terms {{.Name | urlize}}">

          {{ range .Data.Terms.Alphabetical }}
              {{ $size := math.Floor (mul (div (math.Log (len .Pages)) $max) 6) }}
              <li>
                  <a href="/{{ $plural }}/{{ .Name }}" class="{{ printf "terms-size-%.0f" $size }}">{{ .Name }}</a>

Creating font sizes for the CSS is boring.  Let's spit them out in Emacs Lisp!

#+name: terms-sizes-css
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (mapconcat (lambda (x)
               (let ((size (expt 2.0 (/ (- x 2) 4.0))))
                 (format ".terms-size-%i { font-size: %1.3fem; }" x size)))
             (number-sequence 0 6)
             "\n")
#+end_src

Look at all the CSS we didn't have to write:

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css :noweb yes
  <<terms-sizes-css()>>
#+end_src

We still need to handwrite a bit.  This centers the ~.terms~ and
reserves enough line height for the largest:

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  .terms {
      list-style: none;
      padding-left: 0;
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      line-height: 2.25em;
  }
#+end_src

The elements are a regular inline list:

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  .terms li {
      display: inline;
      margin: 0 0.5rem;
  }
#+end_src

Our site convention is that tags receive a ~#~ prefix and categories
get a ~@~.  Give them a tasteful, muted style:

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  .terms.tags li::before {
      content: "#";
  }
  .terms.categories li::before {
      content: "@";
  }
#+end_src

Mute the color and count, because it's all about the terms:

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  .terms li {
      color: #aaa;
  }
#+end_src

***** Configuration

The menu is defined in the site config.  Higher weights come last.

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/config.toml
  [[menu.main]]
  name = 'About'
  url = '/about'
  weight = 1

  [[menu.main]]
  name = 'Blog'
  url = '/blog'
  weight = 100

  [[menu.main]]
  name = 'Talks'
  url = '/talks'
  weight = 120

  [[menu.main]]
  name = 'Projects'
  url = '/projects'
  weight = 130

  [[menu.main]]
  name = 'Configs'
  url = '/configs'
  weight = 140

  [[menu.main]]
  name = 'Categories'
  url = '/categories'
  weight = 500

  [[menu.main]]
  name = 'Tags'
  url = '/tags'
  weight = 510
#+end_src

***** CSS

It's monospace, because it's "code".

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header {
      font-family: "Noto Sans Mono", monospace;
  }
#+end_src

Render each element as a flex:

Introduce the Lisp syntax as CSS content.  The double paren on the
last child is sloppy, but I haven't figured out another way to hug it.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header strong::before {
      content: "(defvar ";
  }
  body > header p::before {
      content: "\"";
  }
  body > header p::after {
      content: "\"";
  }
  body > header nav::before {
      content: "'(";
  }
  body > header > nav > ul > li:last-child::after {
      content: "))";
      white-space: nowrap;
  }
#+end_src

Mute all the frou-frou.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header::before, body > header::after,
  body > header ::before, body > header ::after {
      font-weight: normal; 
      white-space: pre-wrap;
  }
#+end_src

~M-x indent-region~:

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header :first-child {
      padding-left: 0;
  }

  body > header > * {
      padding-left: 2ch;
  }
#+end_src

It's fine and good that the header is bold, but otherwise we want it
to look like the rest.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header strong {
      font-size: 1em;
      line-height: inherit;
      margin: 0;
      font-family: "Noto Sans Mono", monospace;
  }
#+end_src

The site subtitle becomes our "docstring".

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header p {
      margin: 0;
      font-style: italic;
  }
#+end_src

Setting ~display: inline-flex~ on the nav indents things properly in
the quoted list, even across multiple lines.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header > nav {
      display: inline-flex;
  }
#+end_src

The ~ul~ is also ~inline-flex~, to eat the whitespace in the HTML and
let ~li~ set their own padding.  ~flex-wrap~ breaks it across lines
on narrow viewports.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header ul {
      display: inline-flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      list-style: none;
      margin: 0;
  }
#+end_src

Render the HTML list as a Lispy, inline list.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > header li {
      display: inline;
  }
  body > header li {
      padding-right: 1ch;
  }
  body > header li:last-child {
      padding-right: 0;
  }

but could conceivably be used in future projects.
#+hugo:more

**** Box sizing

[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing][~border-box~]] includes the widths of the border and padding in the
width of an element.  This cuts out a lot of ~<div class="container">~
nonsense.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  *, *::before, *::after {
      box-sizing: border-box;
  }
#+end_src

**** Let the body breathe

The [[https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#visual-presentation][Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]] call for a line height of at
least 1.5.

There are more criteria there that are probably worth revisting.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noto_fonts][Noto fonts]] look nice and have a full glyph set.

+We serve them up with [[https://fonts.google.com/][Google Fonts]] with these links in our ~<head>~+.
Google Fonts [[https://cookie-script.com/blog/google-fonts-and-gdpr][violates the GDPR]], so we self host.  I downloaded all the
Noto variants from Google Fonts, and ran them through [[https://transfonter.org/][Transfonter]].

Lots of people use media queries for this, but the clamp function
gives a smooth experience as the window resizes.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css

#+begin_quote
We will fight for
the cream and crimson,
for the glory of old IU
#+end_quote

***** Palette

Define some CSS variables. The link color is complementary to the
crimson.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  :root {
      --color-brand: #9d2235;
      --color-brand-darker: #731927;
      --color-stripe: #ffffff;
      --link-color: #229d8a;
  }
#+end_src

***** Headers

Modern CSS lets us draw stripes without a repeating background GIF.
Neat.  This draws candy stripes next to the ~h1~.  The negative margin
and corresponding padding hang the stripes off to the left.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
    h1 {
        background: linear-gradient(
            to right,
            var(--color-brand) 0,
            var(--color-brand) 2px,
            var(--color-stripe) 2px,
            var(--color-stripe) 4px,
            var(--color-brand) 4px,
            var(--color-brand) 6px,
            var(--color-stripe) 6px,
            var(--color-stripe) 8px,
            var(--color-brand) 8px,
            var(--color-brand) 10px,
            var(--color-stripe) 10px,
            var(--color-stripe) 12px,
            var(--color-brand) 12px,
            var(--color-brand) 14px,
            var(--color-stripe) 14px
        );
        margin-left: -24px;
        padding-left: 24px;
    }
#+end_src

We need to leave space for the negative margin.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  body > * {
      padding: 1.5rem 24px;
  }
#+end_src

Changing the headers to crimson helps tie it to the decorative
stripes.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      color: var(--color-brand);
  }
#+end_src

We'll sort out header sizes later, but the ~h1~ really needs to be
bigger now.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  h1 {
      font-size: 2em;
  }
#+end_src

***** Links

Render the links in the complementary color.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  a {
      color: var(--link-color);
  }
#+end_src

*** Code rendering

Put a scroll bar on code samples, but only where necessary.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  pre {
      max-width: 100%;
      overflow-x: auto;
  }
#+end_src

Give the code samples a little more room to breathe.

#+begin_src css :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/assets/css/cromulent.css
  pre {
      background: #f8f8f8;
      border: 1px dotted #ccc;

:HEADER-ARGS:emacs-lisp: :tangle ../../gen/emacs/init.el :tangle-mode `,#o444
:END:

This is a "vanilla" Emacs configuration built on Emacs 29.  It's not
yet my daily driver.

*** Startup time

I don't [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/35865ef5e89442e3809b8095199977053dd4210f/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly][care as much about startup time as Doom]], but they're the state
of the art.  And with my Nix setup, I'm restarting Emacs a lot
whenever I'm trying new packages.

First, we'll benchmark it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package benchmark-init
    :ensure t
    :demand t
    :hook (after-init . benchmark-init/deactivate)
    :config
    (benchmark-init/activate))
#+end_src

We're going to use [[https://gitlab.com/ajgrf/on.el][on.el]] to provide some Doom-like hooks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package on
    :ensure)
#+end_src

*** Package management

[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is built-in as of Emacs 29, but since we use =:bind=, we
need to load ~bind-key~.  If we forget, we get the error: ~Symbol's
value as variable is void: personal-keybindings~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'bind-key)
#+end_src

*** UI

**** Startup

I don't need a dashboard and I know where the manuals are.  I prefer a
quiet startup.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package "startup"
    :custom
    (inhibit-splash-screen t)
    (initial-major-mode 'fundamental-mode)
    (initial-scratch-message nil))
#+end_src

**** Fonts

We'll default to a 14-point font.  Emacs uses "printer's points", which
are ten to the point.

[[https://www.ibm.com/plex/][IBM Plex Mono]] is used if it's installed.  Their [[https://www.ibm.com/design/language/typography/type-specs-ui/][~code-02~ utility
claas]] suggests a line height of 20px, which translates to a
=line-spacing= of 6.  This is too much.  Particularly, the cursor gets
distractingly tall when the point is not at a character.  [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2015-11/msg00236.html][Bug#21835]] is
related.  ~0.25~ gives the text room to breathe, without the cursor
growing and shrinking by leaps and bounds.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :custom
    (line-spacing 0.25)
    :custom-face
    (default ((t :height 140)))
    :config
    (cond
     ((find-font (font-spec :name "IBM Plex Mono"))
      (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "IBM Plex Mono"))))
#+end_src

An easy way to scale up the font when presenting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ross/set-font-height (height)
    "Sets the default font height to HEIGHT."
    (interactive "NFont height: ")
    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height height))
#+end_src

**** Cursor

I like a non-blinking bar cursor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :custom
    (cursor-type 'bar))
  (use-package frame
    :config
    (blink-cursor-mode -1))
#+end_src

**** Theme

I like the [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes][modus-themes]].  They are built into modern Emacs, but the
author continues to work on them, so we grab them from ELPA with
~:ensure t~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package modus-themes
    :ensure t
    :config
    (load-theme 'modus-operandi :no-confirm))
#+end_src

**** Scrollbars

The modeline tells us where we're at, and we mostly eschew the mouse.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package scroll-bar
    :config
    (scroll-bar-mode -1))
#+end_src

**** Toolbars

The much despised tool bar is not a terrible default for the Emacs
neophyte, but I'm old and grizzled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tool-bar
    :config
    (tool-bar-mode -1))
#+end_src

**** Beep beep, your ass

Decades ago, there was a meme of Wile E. Coyote, having finally caught
Road Runner, saying "Beep beep your ass."  This comes from
approximately the same era as the last time anyone wanted a system
bell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package mode-line-bell
    :ensure
    :hook (on-first-input . mode-line-bell-mode))
#+end_src

*** Tools

**** Direnv

I maintain a minimal home environment and push as much as I can to Nix
flakes.  This insulates me from conflicting dependencies, makes my
projects more portable, and helps me share with Nix-enabled teammates.

Where possible, I add an ~.envrc~ file to load the environment from
the flake.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package envrc
    :ensure t
    :hook (on-first-file . envrc-global-mode))
#+end_src

**** Magit

I have known people to leave Emacs, but continuing to use [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] for
version control.  It's that good.

I am giving builtins the benefit of the doubt in this config, and
would like to get into ~vc-mode~.  But I'm an advanced enough Git user
that something tailor-made carries its weight here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t
    :defer 1
    :bind ("C-c g g" . magit-status))
#+end_src

**** ws-butler

I like builtin packages, but I like minimal diffs more.  [[https://github.com/lewang/ws-butler][ws-butler]] is
"unobtrusive", which wins the day for me.

#+begin_quote
- Only lines touched get trimmed. If the white space at end of buffer
  is changed, then blank lines at the end of buffer are truncated
  respecting =require-final-newline=.
- Trimming only happens when saving.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ws-butler
    :ensure t
    :config
    (ws-butler-global-mode))
#+end_src

*** IDE

**** Language server protocol

We're going to give [[https://joaotavora.github.io/eglot/][eglot]] a try now that it's built into Emacs.  It's
a bit more minimalist than the excellent [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package eglot :defer t)
#+end_src

*** Programming modes

**** Nix

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package nix-mode
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
#+end_src

**** Scala

Much of this configuration starts from the [[https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/emacs/][Metals guide]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package scala-mode
    :ensure t
    :interpreter ("scala" . scala-mode)
    :hook (scala-mode . eglot-ensure))

  (use-package sbt-mode
    :ensure t
    :commands sbt-start sbt-command)
#+end_src

*** Lookup

**** ffap

~ffap~, or Find File At Point, is a transitive dependency of nix-mode.
It invokes ~gcc~ and ~g++~, which is fine, except on a Mac without
Xcode, that brings up a dialog box.

#+begin_src nix :noweb-ref emacs-home-packages
  ({ pkgs, ...}: { home.packages = [ pkgs.gcc ]; })
#+end_src

*** Nix module

This Emacs configuration is built with Nix using [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][emacs-overlay]] and
published to my [[*Nix flake][Nix flake]].

Even though Emacs 29 is not released at the time of writing, git is on
Emacs 30!  We publish an =emacs29= flake package with the desired
branch pinned via the =emacs-src= input.  It's also added to our
default overlay, so it can be used as a dependency by other packages
and apps.  The package has no configuration.

Additionally, an =emacs= flake app is created.  This builds on the
=emacs29= package with the config above to make a usable Emacs.

Finally, we add a Home Manager module based on the configured app.

#+begin_src nix :tangle ../../gen/emacs/default.nix :noweb tangle
  { inputs, lib, moduleWithSystem, ... }: {
    imports = [
      inputs.flake-parts.flakeModules.easyOverlay
    ];
    perSystem = { config, self', inputs', pkgs, system, ... }: {
      overlayAttrs = {
	inherit (config.packages) emacs29;
      };
      packages.emacs29 = pkgs.emacsGit.overrideAttrs (old: {
	name = "emacs29";
	# It's important this starts with the major number for Nix's
	# Emacs infra.  For example, it's used to blank out archaic
	# versions of the Seq package in MELPA.
	version = "29.0-${inputs.emacs-src.shortRev}";
	src = inputs.emacs-src;
      });
      packages.emacs-ross = pkgs.emacsWithPackagesFromUsePackage {
	package = config.packages.emacs29;
	override = epkgs: epkgs // {
	  on = epkgs.trivialBuild {
	    pname = "on.el";
	    src = inputs.on-el;
	  };
	};
	config = ./init.el;
	defaultInitFile = true;
	alwaysEnsure = false;
      };
      apps.emacs = {
	type = "app";
	program = "${config.packages.emacs-ross}/bin/emacs";
      };
    };
    flake = {
      homeManagerModules.emacs = moduleWithSystem (
	perSystem@{ config, pkgs }: {
	  imports = [
            <<emacs-home-packages>>
	  ];
	  programs.emacs = {
	    enable = true;
	    package = config.packages.emacs-ross;
	  };
	}
      );
    };
  }
#+end_src

As long as I have access to Nix, I can install and run my complete
Emacs app as a one-liner.  There's little reason for you to choose it
over a starter kit or your own configuration, but there's also nothing
stopping you!

[[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/][Web Key Directory (WKD)]] is a standard to look up the PGP keys by email
address over HTTPS.

It also fits nicely with Indieweb principles: we remove the dependency
on a third-party key server and are discoverable through
self-publishing.  My self-hosted WKD drives my [[https://keyoxide.org/wkd/ross%40rossabaker.com][Keyoxide profile]] for
verification.

*** Files

Most of the work is serving two static files.

This tutorial assumes the root directory of your static files is =$PUBLIC_HTML=

#+begin_src sh :var PUBLIC_HTML="../../tmp/hugo/static/" :session wkd
  cd $PUBLIC_HTML
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

| sh: cd: ../../tmp/hugo/static/: No such file or directory |

**** ~/.well-known/openpgpkey/policy~

There are [[https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-14.html#name-policy-flags][options]], but in basic usage, all we need to do is serve a
blank file.

#+begin_src sh :session wkd
  mkdir -p .well-known/openpgpkey
  touch .well-known/openpgpkey/policy
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| mkdir: | cannot | create | directory                        | ‘.well-known’: | No   | such | file | or        | directory |
| touch: | cannot | touch  | '.well-known/openpgpkey/policy': | No             | such | file | or   | directory |           |

**** ~/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/:hash~

The key is stored at hash of the local part of the username.
Calculate with ~gpg-wks-client~.  Alternatively, KeyOxide has a [[https://keyoxide.org/util/wkd][web
implementation]].

#+begin_src sh :session wkd
  WKDHASH=$(gpg-wks-client --print-wkd-hash ross@rossabaker.com | awk '{print $1}')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_src sh :session wkd
  mkdir -p .well-known/openpgpkey/hu/
  gpg --export ross@rossabaker.com > .well-known/openpgpkey/hu/$WKDHASH
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| mkdir: | cannot                                                      | create | directory | ‘.well-known’: | No | such      | file | or | directory |

*** Headers

These resources should allow cross-origin requests from any domain.
We deploy to Netlify, and can [[https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#headers][configure this in netlify.toml]].

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/content/netlify.toml :eval no :mkdirp yes
  [[headers]]
    for = "/.well-known/openpgpkey/*"
    [headers.values]
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
#+end_src

*** Testing

Test your work with ~gks-web-client~:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
  gpg-wks-client -v --check ross@rossabaker.com
#+end_src

You should see something like this:

#+begin_example
gpg-wks-client: public key for 'ross@rossabaker.com' found via WKD
gpg-wks-client: gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg-wks-client: fingerprint: 904C153733DBB0106915C0BD975BE5BC29D92CA5

[[https://www.manning.com/books/scalatra-in-action][Scalatra in Action]] was written by [[https://constructiveproof.com/][Dave Hrycyszyn,]] Stefan Ollinger, and
me and covers the [[https://scalatra.org/][Scalatra micro-framework]] in depth.  Scalatra is a
port of Ruby's Sinatra to Scala.

From the publisher:

#+begin_quote
_Scalatra in Action_ covers the Scalatra framework in its entirety,
starting with concepts such as request routing, input handling,
actions, and HTTP responses. For readers who don't already know Scala,
the book introduces the Scala language and sbt, the Simple Build
Tool. You'll learn how to use Scalatra's powerful templating engine,
Scalate. It also covers advanced topics such as data access, handling
heavy load, asynchronicity, securing your application, designing
RESTful APIs, and real-time web programming.

I run my [[https://matrix.to/#/@ross:rossabaker.com][Matrix presence]] on a personal Synapse server in Google Cloud.
Everything described here runs in the free tier, but I am not

*** Terraform

~20.03~ is disappointingly old, but it's the newest one I can find
publicly. I upgraded this on the instance after it was created. It
would be good to get a fresher image on GCS, but it'll cost a few
pennies.

#+begin_src terraform /*:tangle main.tf*/
  module "nixos_image" {
    source = "github.com/tweag/terraform-nixos/google_image_nixos"
    nixos_version = "20.03"
  }
#+end_src

I created this project manually.  To create a project directly, we'd
need another "admin" project to bootstrap things.  The
~"rossabaker-348417"~ is repeated frequently and belongs in a
variable.

#+begin_src terraform /*:tangle main.tf*/
  provider "google" {
    project = "rossabaker-348417"
    region  = "us-central1"
    zone    = "us-central1-c"
  }
#+end_src

These APIs need to be enabled for subsequent calls to work.

#+begin_src terraform /*:tangle main.tf*/
  resource "google_project_service" "compute" {
    project = "rossabaker-348417"
    service = "compute.googleapis.com"
  }

  resource "google_project_service" "oslogin" {
    project = "rossabaker-348417"
    service = "oslogin.googleapis.com"
  }
#+end_src

~enable-oslogin~ lets us log into the machine as our Google identity.
The ~nix-configuration~ is a handy way to expose the NixOS
configuration, since we don't have a custom image to bake it into.

#+begin_src terraform /*:tangle main.tf*/
  resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
    name         = "abe"
    machine_type = "e2-micro"

    boot_disk {
      initialize_params {
        image = module.nixos_image.self_link
        size  = 10
      }
    }

    metadata = {
      enable-oslogin = "TRUE"
      nix-configuration = file("configuration.nix")
    }

    network_interface {
      # A default network is created for all GCP projects
      network = "default"
      access_config {
      }
    }

    tags = ["http-server"]
  }
#+end_src

To refresh the configuration on the instance, we can run:

#+begin_src sh
  curl "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/nix-configuration" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" | sudo tee /etc/nixos/configuration.nix && sudo nixos-rebuild --upgrade switch
#+end_src

The ~http-server~ tag links it up with the VM instance above so the
firewall rules apply.  In hindsight, port ~443~ probably would have
been sufficient here.

#+begin_src terraform /*:tangle main.tf*/
  resource "google_compute_firewall" "http-server" {
    name    = "http-server"
    network = "default"

    allow {
      protocol = "tcp"
      ports    = ["80", "443"]
    }

    source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    target_tags   = ["http-server"]
  }
#+end_src

Make ourselves an admin:

#+begin_src terraform /*:tangle main.tf*/
  resource "google_project_iam_binding" "os-login-admin-users" {
    project = "rossabaker-348417"
    role = "roles/compute.osAdminLogin"

    members = [
      "user:rossabaker@gmail.com"
    ]
  }
#+end_src

Finally, lock our dependencies:

#+begin_src hcl /*:tangle .terraform.lock.hcl*/
  provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google" {
    version = "4.19.0"
    hashes = [

***** Nix

Most of this configuration comes from the [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#module-services-matrix-synapse][Synapse Homeserver]] section
of the NixOS manual.

#+begin_src nix /*:tangle default.nix*/
  { pkgs, lib, modulesPath, ... }:
  {
    imports = [

    networking = {
      hostName = "abe";
      domain = "gcp.rossabaker.com";
    };
    networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 80 443 ];

    security.acme.email = "ross@rossabaker.com";
    security.acme.acceptTerms = true;

    services.postgresql.enable = true;
    services.postgresql.initialScript = pkgs.writeText "synapse-init.sql" ''
      CREATE ROLE "matrix-synapse" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'synapse';
      CREATE DATABASE "matrix-synapse" WITH OWNER "matrix-synapse"
        TEMPLATE template0
        LC_COLLATE = "C"
        LC_CTYPE = "C";
    '';

    services.nginx = {

      # but the rest make sense as well
      recommendedTlsSettings = true;

      recommendedGzipSettings = true;
      recommendedProxySettings = true;

      virtualHosts = {
        # Reverse proxy for Matrix client-server and server-server communication
        "matrix.rossabaker.com" = {
          enableACME = true;
          forceSSL = true;

          # Or do a redirect instead of the 404, or whatever is appropriate for you.
          # But do not put a Matrix Web client here! See the Element web section below.
          locations."/".extraConfig = ''
            return 404;
          '';

          # forward all Matrix API calls to the synapse Matrix homeserver
          locations."/_matrix" = {
            proxyPass = "http://[::1]:8008"; # without a trailing /

        };
      };
    };
    services.matrix-synapse = {
      enable = true;
      settings = {
        server_name = "rossabaker.com";
        listeners = [
          {
            port = 8008;
            bind_addresses = [ "::1" ];
            type = "http";
            tls = false;

                compress = false;
              }
            ];
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  }
#+end_src

The password in ~initialScript~ is gross, but NixOS' PostgreSQL
defaults to peer authentication for domain sockets, and we don't
expose Postgres outside the localhost.  Just to be extra safe, I
manually ran:

#+begin_src sql
  ALTER ROLE "matrix-synapse" PASSWORD null;
#+end_src

*** Federation

Federation is configured via the ~.well-known~ directory.  All we need
are two static files:

***** ~/.well-known/matrix/server~

#+begin_src json :tangle "../../tmp/hugo/static/.well-known/matrix/server" :eval no :mkdirp yes :eval no :mkdirp yes
  {
    "m.server": "matrix.rossabaker.com:443"
  }
#+end_src

***** ~/.well-known/matrix/client~

#+begin_src json :tangle "../../tmp/hugo/static/.well-known/matrix/client" :eval no :mkdirp yes
  {
    "m.homeserver": {
      "base_url": "https://matrix.rossabaker.com"
    },
    "m.identity_server": {
       "base_url": "https://vector.im"
    }
  }
#+end_src

***** CORS headers

The well-known files need CORS headers.  If deploying to Netlify, add this to ~netlify.toml~:

#+begin_src conf-toml :tangle ../../tmp/hugo/content/netlify.toml :eval no :mkdirp yes
  [[headers]]
    for = "/.well-known/matrix/*"
    [headers.values]
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
#+end_src

:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: How to batch archive an exported stream of Mastodon toots to a Hugo website using Scala CLI
:EXPORT_OPTIONS: h:6
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: toot-archive
:END:
a
An important Indieweb principle is to [[https://indieweb.org/own_your_data][own your data]].  I tooted on
[[https://mastodon.social/web/@rossabaker][mastodon.social]] sporadically for five years.  The service is public,
the protocol open, and the implementation open source.  Still, it
exists at the pleasure of its admins, with whom I have no contract.

After moving to [[https://indieweb.social/web/@rossabaker][another instance]], I wanted to preserve my old content.
We will use a technique called [[https://indieweb.org/PESOS][PESOS]], or Pubish Elsewhere, Syndicate
to Own Site.

*** Request your archive

The first step is to [[https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#export][request your archive]].  This can be done once
every seven days.  PESOS is typically done more often, but it's async.
Ours just took years.[fn:12]

Download the archive.  Inside the archive is an ~outbox.json~ file in
[[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/][Activity Streams]] format.  The interesting part is the ~orderedItems~
array.

#+end_src

*** The end goal

Our goal is to parse the activity stream, and render each toot to our
website.  For Hugo, we want to render somewhere in the ~content~
directory.

Hugo content begins with [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/][front matter]].  Our target looks like:
- the ~date~
- the ~canonical~ URI of the original toot
- an array of ~tags~

#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
  Example Hugo content for a toot
#+end_summary

#+begin_src markdown
  +++
  date = 2017-04-02T03:08:25Z
  canonical = "https://mastodon.social/users/rossabaker/statuses/1426597"
  tags = [  ]
  +++

  <p>brb, importing all my Google+ circles</p>
#+end_src
#+end_details

We also don't want all our toots.  We will omit:
- boosts (which are someone else's content)
- replies (which lack context)

*** Extraction script

We'll use [[https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/][scala-cli]] to write a Scala script.  Scala isn't a
traditional scripting language, but I have more silos to export, and
all the types will come in handy if this grows into more than a
one-off.

If you have scala-cli and don't need a play-by-play, skip ahead to [[*Run it yourself][run
it yourself]].

**** Dependencies

This script uses [[https://fs2.io/#/][fs2]] and [[https://circe.github.io/circe/][circe]].  These lines fetch those dependencies:

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  //> using lib "co.fs2::fs2-io:3.3.0"
  //> using lib "io.circe::circe-parser:0.14.3"
#+end_src

**** Imports

The imports are boring, but we'll need them.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  import cats._
  import cats.effect._
  import cats.effect.std.Console
  import cats.effect.unsafe.implicits.global
  import cats.implicits._
  import fs2.{Pipe, Stream}
  import fs2.io.file.{Files, Path}
  import fs2.text
  import io.circe._
  import io.circe.Decoder.Result
  import io.circe.parser._
#+end_src

**** Configuration

=input= is the path to the Activity Stream, and =output= is the
directory to which we'll write the Hugo content.  These ought to be
command line arguments, but this will do.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  val input = Path("./outbox.json")
  val output = Path("./src/hugo/content/notes/toots")
#+end_src

We also need to supply our identity for filtering.  No trailing slash!

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  val me = "https://mastodon.social/users/rossabaker"
#+end_src

**** Parsing

***** Streaming the toot JSON

This function parses =input= and returns a stream of Circe JSON
objects, one per toot.

Note that the parser itself is not streaming.  A large activity stream
will be buffered into memory.  It would be better to use [[https://github.com/typelevel/jawn-fs2][jawn-fs2]]
here, but that only streams top-level JSON arrays, and we have to dive
into ~ordered-items~.  Bummer.  By returning a stream now, we're well
poised to use a streaming parser later.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def parseToots[F[_]: ApplicativeThrow: Files]: Stream[F, Json] =
    Files[F]
      .readAll(input)
      .through(text.utf8.decode)
      .foldMonoid
      .map(parse)
      .rethrow
      .map(_.hcursor.get[Vector[Json]]("orderedItems"))
      .rethrow
      .flatMap(Stream.emits)
#+end_src

***** Filters

Instead of simple predicates, our filters return an `F[Boolean]`
to provide an error channel in case of JSON parsing failure.  If we
made a bad assumption, we want the export to fail so we can adjust
the script.

****** Separating toots from boosts

Our toots have a ~type~ of ~"Create"~.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def created[F[_]: ApplicativeThrow](json: Json): F[Boolean] =
    json.hcursor
      .get[String]("type")
      .map(_ === "Create")
      .liftTo[F]
#+end_src

****** Filter out replies

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def topLevel[F[_]: ApplicativeThrow](json: Json): F[Boolean] =
    json.hcursor
      .downField("object")
      .get[Json]("inReplyTo")
      .map(_.isNull)
      .liftTo[F]
#+end_src

****** Only me

A few toots are "top-level", but are replies to a protected user.  We
can filter these out by filtering tweets that our followers are
~cc~'ed on.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def ccsMyFollowers[F[_]: ApplicativeThrow](json: Json): F[Boolean] =
    json.hcursor
      .downField("object")
      .get[Set[String]]("cc")
      .map(_.contains(s"${me}/followers"))
      .liftTo[F]
#+end_src

**** ID extractor

We want the numeric ID of the toot, which only appears as part of a
URI.  We need to parse the JSON, and then get the last segment.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def getId[F[_]: ApplicativeThrow](json: Json): F[Long] =
    json.hcursor
      .downField("object")
      .get[String]("id")
      .map(_.split("/").last.toLong)
      .liftTo[F]
#+end_src

**** Tag extractor

Good Fediverse practice is to [[https://indieweb.social/web/@Tam5@mastodon.social/109305286914653844][render hashtags in CamelCase]], but our
Hugo tags are lower-kebab-case.  Some of our toots are older than this
wisdom.  This function massages some toot tags to fit our site's tags,
and kebab-cases the rest.

In the long run, this mapping should be parameterized.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def getHashtags(json: Json): Decoder.Result[Vector[String]] =
    json.hcursor
      .downField("object")
      .get[Vector[Map[String, String]]]("tag")
      .map(_.collect {
        case m if m.get("type") === Some("Hashtag") =>
          "\"" + (m("name") match {
            case "#AllSaintsSunday" => "all-saints-sunday"
            case "#GoIU" => "hoosiers"
            case "#GoingViral" => "going-viral"
            case "#ScalaCLI" => "scala-cli"
            case "#contentwarning" => "content-warning"
            case "#cw" => "content-warning"
            case "#indiewebsocial" => "indieweb-social"
            case "#italianbeef" => "italian-beef"
            case "#opentelemetry" => "open-telemetry"
            case "#orgmode" => "org-mode"
            case "#ownyourdata" => "own-your-data"
            case "#thedecision" => "the-decision"
            case "#trickortreat" => "trick-or-treat"
            case "#tuxedocat" => "tuxedo-cat"
            case "#underconstruction" => "under-construction"
            case other =>
              other.split("[\\W_]+")
                .filter(_.nonEmpty)
                .map(_.toLowerCase(java.util.Locale.ROOT))
              .mkString("-")
          }) + "\""
      })
#+end_src

**** Render the toot to Hugo content

This function converts the JSON to Hugo content.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def renderToot[F[_]: ApplicativeThrow](json: Json): F[String] =
    (json.hcursor.downField("object").get[String]("published"),
     json.hcursor.downField("object").get[String]("id"),
     json.hcursor.downField("object").get[String]("content"),
     getHashtags(json)
    ).mapN(
      (published, id, content, hashtags) =>
         List(
           "+++",
           s"date = ${published}",
           s"""canonical = "${id}"""",
           s"""tags = [ ${hashtags.mkString(", ")} ]""",
           "+++",
           "",
           content,
           ""
         ).mkString("\n")
    )
    .liftTo[F]
#+end_src

**** Render the Hugo content string to disk

Writing the file is a simple streaming operation.  The stream returns
=Unit=, because it's run for its side effect.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def handleToot[F[_]: MonadThrow: Files](json: Json): Stream[F, Unit] =
    for {
      id <- Stream.eval(getId(json))
      _ <- Stream.eval(renderToot(json))
        .through(text.utf8.encode)
        .through(Files[F].writeAll(output / s"${id}.md"))
    } yield ()
#+end_src

**** Putting it all together

Our program makes the output directory, parses the toots, filters the
content, and writes them to disk.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  def program[F[_]: Sync: Files]: F[Unit] =
    Files[F].createDirectories(output) >>
    parseToots
      .evalFilter(created[F])
      .evalFilter(topLevel[F])
      .evalFilter(ccsMyFollowers[F])
      .flatMap(handleToot[F])
      .compile
      .drain
#+end_src

**** Main method

This is a functional program.  Nothing has run yet!  Every result is
in a parameterized =F=.  We'll use the traditional =IO=.

Scala CLI has a [[https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/faq#scala-cli][known limitation]] with =unsafeRunSync()=, so the whole
file needs to have a ~*.scala~ suffix and an =IOApp=.

#+begin_src scala :tangle ../../gen/scala/toot-archive.scala
  object Main extends IOApp.Simple {
    def run: IO[Unit] = program[IO]
  }
#+end_src

*** Run it yourself

The entire script is [[https://github.com/rossabaker/cromulent/blob/main/gen/scala/toot-archive.scala][on GitHub]].  You can run it directly, but you'll
want to download it as ~toot-archive.scala~ and and customize at least
the =me= variable.  Get ~outbox.json~ in the same directory, and run:

#+begin_src sh
  scala-cli run toot-archive.scala
#+end_src

Your toots should be in ~./src/hugo/content/notes/toots~.

A nice Hugo layout is a post for another day, but the end result can
be seen in [[/notes][~/notes~]].

*** Next steps

1. Add command line parsing
2. Package it as a Nix package, so users don't need ~scala-cli~.
3. Create similar for Twitter and Facebook.
4. Drop toots that link back to own domain
5. Trim trailing hashtags

*** Static solution

We could copy the above JSON response and serve it on our own static
server at the ~/.well-known/webfinger~ path.  It works!
Unfortunately, a static server ignores the query string (i.e.,
~resource=acct:ross@rossabaker.com~).  This becomes effectively a
wildcard address: /any/ username ~@rossabaker.com~ would point to my
indieweb.social account.  This is mostly harmless and works with any
static site generator, but we can do better.

*** Netlify redirect

The resource can also be referenced via HTTP redirect.  Our site
deploys to Netlify, which has [[https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/][redirect support]], including matching
query strings!  A one-liner served up at ~/_redirects~ is sufficient:

#+begin_src text

We're not being very good [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033.html][RFC7033]] citizens yet.  Specifically, we are
called to return an HTTP 400 when the ~resource~ parameter is missing.

#+begin_quote

The promise of functional programming is code that is easier to reason
about, test and maintain. Referential transparency means there is no
extra context to worry about, we can just focus on inputs and
outputs. Examples of functional programming in the small are
plentiful. Fibonacci is easy to write as a function but what about fp
in the large?

Http4s is a web framework written in scala that takes a pure

This is an edited version of a draft that circulated in February, 2022.
#+end_aside

*** Maybe it's good that I started behind a wall

My online life began in 1995, in AOL's walled garden of chat.  It was
mostly a wasteland of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age/sex/location][a/s/l]]", but there was ample opportunity for
serious discussion.  I could practice German, with native speakers,
from Middle America!
#+hugo:more
I was not yet a serious person.  With a naughty phrasebook and
sophomoric wit, my friend and I carefully transcribed, "/Hat dir Jemand ins
Gehirn geschissen und vergessen umzurühren?/"[fn:3].  We were abruptly
disconnected and banned.

*** First frolics on the open web

I dusted myself off and ventured onto the public internet.  It was
marvelous.  I learned about the web setting up [[http://www.scriptarchive.com/wwwboard.html][Matt's Script Archive]]
and talking to others on their boards.  We made [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring][web rings]] and
organized ourselves through web directories like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMOZ][dmoz]].  A succession
of search engines began indexing the Web for us, while other services
like [[http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/usenet/deja/][DejaNews]] crawled [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet][Usenet]].  The golden eras of mailing lists and
blogs came and went, each contributing to the digital commons.

*** The rise and fall of Gitter

In the mid-2010s, [[https://gitter.im/][Gitter]] chat became an important hub for developers.
To this day, its archives serve as a primary source.  Most original
[[https://github.com/typelevel/cats][Cats]] authors have moved on, but we can [[https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats/archives/2015/01/29][observe its Big Bang]].  There
are years of insights there, referenced from the issue trackers and
indexed by Google.  These archives are admittedly precarious — none of
us pay for their upkeep — but it was an open product for an Open Web.

The Gitter UX grew derelict, and many OSS projects withdrew to gated
communities like Discord and Slack.  These apps are fine for
fellowship, but come at an unbearable cost to the project's history
and discoverability.  Questions recur, but the search engines no
longer reference the answers.  Prospective members who have the right
keywords fail to connect with their kindred spirits.  These closed
platforms are the AOL of the 2020s, and are anathema to Open Source.

*** Recommitment to the open web

I have many niche interests, and I'm not attempting to maximize my
following.  I want my efforts to reverberate.

- My current role involves a lot of teaching.  We use Slack,
  which is fair game in private enterprise, but I will expound
  what I can on this [[*Blog][nascent blog]].

- I am slowly republishing my old [[*Talks][talks]] here, with a couple new ones
  to share.

- I will continue to explore [[https://indieweb.social/@rossabaker][Mastodon]] for conversing on technical
  subjects.  You need a login to participate, but not to view.

- [[https://matrix.to/#/@ross:rossabaker.com][Matrix]] is the natural, open successor to Gitter.  I've drastically
  curtailed my chatting, but you might nerdsnipe me into a public room
  there.

# TODO absoulte link, because bundle names can't be tag names

- I challenge you to contribute back to the open web.  [[/configs/website][My setup]] is
  arcane, but it's documented and I've recaptured some Joy of
  Computing in building it.  Find yours.

CLOSED: [2022-09-12 Mon 00:32]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: running-up-the-score-in-scrabble
:END:

#+begin_aside
  My grandmother recently passed away.  A lightly edited version of
  this was read at her memorial service.
#+end_aside

Grandma and I had a tradition of playing Scrabble.  We used her
vintage set.  It still had score pads with games featuring players
further up the family tree.  It was intimidating.  I feared I might
draw a "þ" or "æ", just like Chaucer used to play.  But it was indeed
the Modern English Alphabet Edition.  True to her meticulous nature,
it retained all its original pieces.
#+hugo:more
She won the first several matches.  One time, having sealed another
victory, she remained hunched over the rack, running up the score on
her own grandson.  "Really, Grandma?"  She explained that
it's not worth doing if it's not worth your best.  She also pointed
out I lost when I hung a vowel too close to the triple word score.

Her blood runs in my veins, which means I am also stubborn.  I vowed
to beat her.  I read a strategy book.  When we met again, no more long
words.  Trench warfare!  Both scores were low, but she was prepared.
She was always prepared.  She put me away with a "jo."

"It's a Scottish sweetheart," she said.

"Isn't that a foreign word?" I protested.

"She's been playing that one for years," my aunt sighed.  We didn't
have the official Scrabble Dictionary, but still bitter, I checked
[[https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/tools#dictionary][hasbro.com's dictionary]] this week.  Grandma was right, you know.

She came to one of my softball games.  I didn't play well, but she
asked if I played my best.  She realized that I would not succeed Ryne
Sandberg as the Cubs' second baseman a couple years before I did.  It
was my best.

Another time, she asked me about a poor grade.  "To whom much is
given, much is expected," she said.  I didn't recognize the scriptural
reference[fn:1] at the time, but those words from her faith still hit
me like a truck.  It wasn't my best.  I had disappointed her.

She gave me more tips than I ever got from that Scrabble book.
Eventually, I beat her.  I never got the consistent upper hand in our
series, but she made me better, in so many ways.  She was a gifted
teacher and motivator, and her calling was to bring out the best in
all of us.

All games come to an end.  After 97 years, Grandma played her last
tile, and I can imagine her at the Pearly Gates to tally the final
score.  "I say, hand me the top of the box, would you?" she surely
told St. Peter.  "I want to look at the rules!"  She was such a
stickler for the rules.  But not to worry, Grandma: you /always/ did
your best.

The Wayback Machine has preserved my [[https://web.archive.org/web/19981203135416/http://user.mc.net/%7Eotis/][juvenilia]].  The soft tissue is
gone, but here is the skeleton of a twentieth-century personal web
page, the author not yet twenty.  There was a Perl CGI script to show
football schedules.  Navigation was a Java applet, for crude
animations that JavaScript could not yet render.  There was a boast
about my girlfriend[fn:4].  Ugh, the justified margins!

Unfortunately, it was all hosted at the internet service provider in
the back of the video cassette rental store.  It's incredible we found
any remains of Teenage Ross.

*** A gap in the fossil record

As the 21st Century dawned, the Web and I each got serious.  It was
time to put the applets away and drop the handle "Spanky"[fn:6].  I
had swirling thoughts about:
- aspect-oriented programming
- pairwise comparison algorihthms to rank intercollegiate athletic teams
- the inadequecy of ID3 tags for organizing a large MP3 collection
- the urgency of proportional representation
- and so much more

I was also reading too many blogs about blogging, and concluded that
none of these thoughts where polished enough to contribute to my
Personal Brand™.  I didn't develop a brand at all.  Vicenarian Ross
was lost to perfectionism.

*** Social media siloes

In 2008, I was cajoled into joining Facebook, and I resumed expressing
myself in its [[https://www.spudart.org/blog/new-art-monday-pieces-flair/][Pieces of Flair]] app.  I'd show you my board, but it's
not mine to share.  It's gone forever, unless Mark Zuckerberg elects
to hang it on the walls of his Metaverse.

A few months later, I joined Twitter.  I tweeted about 9,500 times,
and you can read them all there today.  Will we be able to read them
in 25 years?  Doubtful.  I downloaded my archive before I left, and I
might rerecord the greatest hits, but the original masters belong to
the label.

Facebook and Twitter got me creating again, worry free, in chunks of
10 kilopixels or 280 words.  But if these tech giants seem mighty, so
did the video rental business with the 56kbps dial-up.  Tricenarian
Ross is buried in the rubble.

announcing a grand opening, but that's a stall tactic: there is no
perfect.  Platforms like Medium and Substack remove the distractions,
but preserve nothing.

So, I am finally [[*Blog][blogging]] here, in my own domain.  I'm assembling an
archive of old [[*Talks][talks]].  I'll have more literate [[*Configurations][configurations]] to
share.  I'm thinking about how integrate the old tweets and the new
toots[fn:9].

I cringed while revisiting my old self, but I quickly appreciated the
ways I've grown.  If I get it right, this project will preserve
Quadragenarian Ross as an embarrassment for decades to come.[fn:8]

#+begin_description
Just a week of detox on the Fediverse brought back all the excitement
of being new on the Internet.
#+end_description

I [[https://twitter.com/rossabaker/status/1585794629529501698][suspended my Twitter]] a week ago today, barely beating rush hour as
~#twexit~ traffic clogged the Information Superhighway.  Today I
exuberated, "[[https://indieweb.social/@rossabaker/109280455333589492][Computers are fun again!]]"

*** Open Source is more than code

For a decade, my online identity has been Scala.  A full community
pathology is best left to another post, but ever since its good parts
[[https://typelevel.org/blog/2021/05/05/discord-migration.html][retreated to Fort Discord]], I have felt adrift.  Open Source is focused
on the license of the code, but it's not (yet) something materalized
from a GPT-3 model.  It springs forth from human collaboration.  That
human history is a complementary and equally valuable artifact, and
deserves more care.

I still enjoy the language.  There are still good people in it.  I
teach it at work to wonderful mentees and still contribute to its
libraries.  But something is missing.

*** A serendipitous blog

Twitter became my primary connection to the tech community.  I wrapped
myself in a mute bubble, but maintaining its community accounts was
corrosive.  Alexandru Nedelcu's [[https://alexn.org/blog/2022/04/01/blogging/][return to blogging]] was fresh as
Twitter destabilized, the right words at the right time.  I decided
then I would follow his lead, even though I'm now months behind.

As I prepared, I discovered the concept of the Indieweb.  Yes!
Gitter, the former chat home of Scala, was public, but it was never
ours.  My Twitter was never mine.  But these people get it.

*** Choosing an instance

I had been off and on Mastodon since April 2017[fn:10], but never with
this seriousness.  It was time for a move from "the default instance."

The obvious choice is [[https://fosstodon.org/about/more][Fosstodon]], where I have many friends and subject
matter expertise.  Its [[https://hub.fosstodon.org/why-fosstodon-is-english-only/][English-only policy]], while understandable, gave
me pause.  Un dia me gustaria in meiner zweiten und dritten Sprache
tuten.[fn:11] I'm glad it's there, but it's not right for me.

Then I found [[https://indieweb.social/web/home][indieweb.social]].  It's a little less aligned with my
established interests, but it has the nutrients that Scala currently
lacks.  The Indieweb supports the human side of Open Source.  I am
already enriched by the community I've discovered here.  There's even
one intrepid soul trying out my blogging apparatus.

*** What's next

There's a certain irony in putting content on an domain containing
~indieweb~, whose plug could be pulled at any moment.  I'm thinking
about the best way to integrate microblogging into this static site
generator.

I'm also [[https://www.patreon.com/indiewebsocial/about][supporting my friendly admin]].  Wherever you land in the

:END:

#+begin_description
  Why I started ripping out [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], and why I came back.
#+end_description

This site is built on a static site generator (SSG).  They are a dime
a dozen.  I chose a less mainstream one, [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]].  After recently
questioning that choice, I have new clarity on why it's right for me.

*** The goal

I want to write and sometimes generate content in a markup language.
The SSG generator should apply a template, create aggregate views
(such as [[/tags][tags]]), and output a directory that can be served off a cloud
CDN, self-hosted with open source like [[https://nginx.org/en/][nginx]], or even out of a local
directory with a [[https://crates.io/crates/simple-http-server][simple Rust binary]].

*** Markup

The first choice is which markup language we use.

**** HTML

Of course, HTML is our target, and the ML even stands for Markup
Language.  But we don't generally want to write HTML directly.

- It's verbose.
- It's subjectively ugly in source form.
- It's not the right level of abstraction for templating.  We can wrap
  a document with ~<main>~, but it still needs metadata for the
  ~<head>~ and aggregate views.  There's [[https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/][XSLT]], which makes hard things
  possible, but easy things hard.

**** Markdown

[[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]] addresses most of these concerns.  It's relatively concise.
It imposes minimal syntax on plain text content.  There are umpteen
generators to export it into HTML.  Its minimalism makes it easy to
generate or collaboratively produce, and its prominence on GitHub
means most engineers in particular can communicate in it.

Why not Markdown?  The umpteen generators mean there are multiple
dialects like [[https://commonmark.org/][CommonMark]] and [[https://github.github.com/gfm/][GitHub Flavored Markdown]] and variable
support for extension for simple needs like tables and definition
lists.

But, eh, it's mostly fine.

**** Org-Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] is a package built into [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], my editor of choice.  It
defines an [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][Org syntax]], which is yet another markdown language[fn:13].
The killer feature is [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][Org-Babel]], where we can embed, export, and
execute code snippets in multiple languages, interspersed with prose
in the practice of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]].  For example, [[*Web Key Directory][Web Key
Directory]] page is not only a tutorial on WKD, but is an executable
document that generates my WKD entry.

It's not /just/ an Emacs tool.  There are [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tools/index.html#orgdf545ac][parsers]] for multiple
languages.  But if you propose Org on a team, some Emacs users and
/all/ Emacs infidels will look at you strange.

**** Decision

I chose Markdown when I'm maintaining the [[https://northsidesoccer.com/][youth soccer league's site]]
with simple needs.  Here, where I'm a sole engineer talking tech, I
choose Org.

*** Generator

**** ox-html

Having settled on Org, a natural choice is [[https://orgmode.org/manual/HTML-Export.html][ox-html]], Org's built in
HTML exporter.  It offers a plain experience out of the box, but there
are enough hooks to fully customize the output.  I tried simplifying
to it earlier this week, but there are so many yaks to shave:

- Exported headers get non-deterministic anchors
- No taxonomies out of the box
- No CSS asset pipeline out the box
- No Google sitemap out of the box
- No RSS feeds out of the box

I could solve all those, and it would be fun.  However, there are a
lot of unsolved problems in the world, and these have been solved many
times over.

Even if I made a bespoke ox-html config, it's not fast and it's
single-threaded.  It's plenty adequate for this modest blog and my few
configs, but I'm starting to think about handling [[https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/][webmentions]],
republishing my Twitter archives, and syndicating content from social
media like Mastodon.  Tens of documents could be come a thousand
quickly.

**** Hugo

[[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] is a prominent static site generator, written in Go.  I don't
love writing Go, but I appreciate consuming the single static binaries
Go produces.  This puts it ahead of predecessors like [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] and its
Gemfile locks.

Hugo is a mature solution that provides all the features and speed I
miss in ox-html.  It also supports [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#list-of-content-formats][Org and Markdown]] content.  The
markup is typically prepended with [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/][front matter]] to provide metadata
like titles, dates, and tags.

What's wrong?  The Org support is based on [[https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org][go-org]], which targets a
"reasonable subset of Org mode" and "likes to follow the 80/20 rule".
That's great, but Babel support falls into the 20%.  I still need
Emacs.

**** ox-hugo

Hugo makes a compelling /compilation target/.  What if I could write
my configs in Org-Babel and export with the full power of Emacs, but
also generate and integrate Markdown files for projects like the [[*Archive your toots to Hugo][toot
archive]], and rebuild it all quickly?

This is exactly what ox-hugo does.  The "ox" in ox-hugo and ox-html
refers to [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][Org eXport]].  ox-hugo is just another ox backend, but exports
to markdown with front matter.  Then Hugo, agnostic to Emacs, converts
that into the HTML you're consuming now.

This tool increases the learning curve.  One needs at least a basic
understanding of Org, Emacs, and Hugo.  It sometimes introduces
overlapping ways to do things, like [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/shortcodes/][Org special blocks vs. Hugo
shortcodes]].  But I have the power where I need it, and a commmodity
platform where a commodity suffices.

I wouldn't want to impose this on the volunteer parent who eventually
takes my spot on the youth soccer board.  But for a personal website
of an Emacs nerd, I highly recommend checking out ox-hugo!

* Stashed

** Old home page copy
I came online a little after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September][The September That Never Ended]], but long
before [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0][Web 2.0]].  I don't feel that old, but my internet age is in the
99th percentile[fn:2].  Analysts rate my curmudgeonhood even
higher.

I still love the ideals of the Open Web, but we are goaded by siloed
apps, follower counts, reaction emoji, and chum boxes.  Today, there
are so many more cool things to discuss, billions more to discuss them
with, and such dreadful mediums we've built to discuss them in.

This project hopes to bring the old wonder to the modern Web.  It
hosts an experiment in [[*Configurations][literate configuration]] and an [[*Blog][inchoate blog]].
Archives of my [[*Talks][talks]], [[/projects][projects]], and [[*Podcasts][podcasts]] are under
construction.  I suggest the [[/categories][categories]] (coarse) or [[/tags][tags]] (fine) to
zoom in on shared interests.

I hope you find something here to enjoy, and I hope it inspires you to
contribute to the open web, too.
