My humble contribution to the Indieweb.

- [[./blog][/blog]] :: longer form posts. snapshots.
- [[file:configs/index.org][/configs]] :: literate configurations. evolving.

Because I am a dork, I am converting this site to a [[file:configs/website.org][custom Org-Export
backend]].  You may see two styles, find broken links, and hear loud
cursing noises in the background.  Everything but the cursing is
temporary.
