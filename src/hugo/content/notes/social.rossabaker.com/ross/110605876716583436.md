<p>Problem: for weeks, I&#39;ve only been able to listen in Spanish on the Android MLB app.  The English feed hangs indefinitely &quot;Buffering&quot;.  This is a widely reported issue.</p><p>Solution: select the English station and hit the rewind 10 seconds button.  It starts immediately.</p><p>I might keep a couple innings a day in Spanish to keep sharpening my skills!</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/MLB" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>MLB</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Android" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Android</span></a></p>
