<p>Season finale tournament.  We opened our three team group tonight, where just one advances.  We threatened multiple times, but conceded a fluke goal.  With 15 minutes to equalize, lightning cut short a 0-1 loss.  Our league gives a fourth point for shutouts (WTF?), so now we must keep a clean sheet for any chance at the final.  The math is brutal, but the team is inspiring, and I will miss them when it&#39;s over.</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/YouthSoccer" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>YouthSoccer</span></a></p>
