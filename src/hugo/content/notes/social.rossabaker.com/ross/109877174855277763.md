<p>Had a fun conversation with a <span class="h-card"><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@zachmccoy" class="u-url mention">@<span>zachmccoy</span></a></span> about graphing second derivatives with Prometheus, until we realized I did that with another backend a couple years before Prometheus came to prominence, and now One Derivative Is Enough For Anybody.</p><p>Also fondly remembering my third derivative, which was mostly useful so I could call it The Jerk Graph.</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Prometheus" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Prometheus</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Calculus" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Calculus</span></a></p>
