<p>Need to add one line to kid&#39;s soccer league site that we are in Indiana, and all you Ohioans need to s/.com/.org/.</p><p>The custom theme from 2020 is too old for modern Hugo.  Ugh.  I pinned it with Nix, but that old nixpkgs doesn&#39;t work on Apple Silicon.  Upgrading the theme is a beast.  Everything is terrible.</p><p>But change a version and a couple hashes, and I quickly rebuilt the precise old Hugo from source, which is now cached.  Go home, Ohioans.</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Nix" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Nix</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Hugo" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Hugo</span></a></p>
