<p>I&#39;m off Twitter.  I avoid r/scala and Discord like var and null.  I don&#39;t read the contributors forum.  I don&#39;t engage on the core GitHubs.  Still, I inferred the origin and nature of the latest drama.</p><p>I&#39;m still having great fun with the language at work and in the outlying repos.  Discussion on the Fediverse has been an oasis.  But, for fuck&#39;s sake.</p>
