<p>In Extreme Programming, we picked a new pair programmer every day.  I decided that was nonsense, and adopted Pete.  We paired for the next nineteen years.  He preferred the title &quot;alpha&quot; to &quot;principal staff,&quot; but he shared his opinions whether you wanted them or not.  He logged off this morning.  Rest easy, friend.</p><p>P.S., this is what he thought of YAML.</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/TuxedoCat" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>TuxedoCat</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/RIP" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>RIP</span></a></p>
