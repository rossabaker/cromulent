<p>It&#39;s not the repeated accusations of racism from people who don&#39;t know my life that burn me out.  I can easily file that away next to my monad transformers getting blamed for global warming.</p><p>But have you never been stuck working with such people?  Would you do so for free?  When you demand it of your maintainers, *that&#39;s* how the joie de OSS dies.
