<p>Uncharacteristically forgot my mask before kid&#39;s appointment.  </p><p>&quot;Finally unmasked!  I&#39;ve read all the science!  If I get it again, I get it again.  You know, I had a fever of 106 the first time?&quot;</p><p>Cool story, bro.  I&#39;ve never had it, and I&#39;ll be outside.</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Covid" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Covid</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/MaskShaming" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>MaskShaming</span></a></p>
