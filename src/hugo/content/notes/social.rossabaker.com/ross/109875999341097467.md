<p>How is there no toggle to disable Apple Music, which I don&#39;t use, from launching every time I connect my Bluetooth headphones.  I don&#39;t even have an Apple account.</p><p>Much as I applaud the idea of a desktop that &quot;just works,&quot; it comes at the expense of our ability to fix the things that just don&#39;t.</p>
