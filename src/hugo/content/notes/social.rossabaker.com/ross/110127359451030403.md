<p>The violin soloist gets to tour with their favorite Italian instrument from Sixteen Dickety-Two, but the piano soloist has to play whatever&#39;s there.  I like to imagine violinists maintain elaborate Emacs configs, and pianists run Vim with no config because &quot;it&#39;s installed everywhere.&quot;<br />  <br /><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/ClassicalMusic" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>ClassicalMusic</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Emacs" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Emacs</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Vim" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Vim</span></a></p>
