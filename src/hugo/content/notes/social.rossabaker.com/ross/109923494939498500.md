<p>Tonight the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra performed Pavel Haas&#39; unfinished symphony in its North American premier.  It was unfinished because the composer was murdered in Auschwitz.  Some premieres are moving, and some premieres are obscure for a reason.  This was moving, and I hope it&#39;s heard in your city someday.</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/IndySymphony" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>IndySymphony</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Indianapolis" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Indianapolis</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/ClassicalMusic" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>ClassicalMusic</span></a></p>
