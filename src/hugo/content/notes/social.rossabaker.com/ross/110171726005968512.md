<p>Happy Easter, if that&#39;s your jam.</p><p>Another spring tradition here is to get flowers in the color of whoever defeats Duke in the NCAA Basketball Tournament.  I convinced Kid 2 that Duke&#39;s tears are what makes the flowers grow.  Still blooming!</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Easter" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Easter</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Grilling" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Grilling</span></a> <a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/CollegeBasketball" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>CollegeBasketball</span></a></p>
