<p>As a child, I didn&#39;t have portable electronics to play with or siblings to fart on, so on long drives, I kept a checklist until I spotted a license plate from all 50 states.  Hawai`i was last, but I saw them all.</p><p>Anyway, there&#39;s a Nassau-Bahamas plate at the Indianapolis Menards if you hurry.</p><p><a href="https://social.rossabaker.com/tags/Nostalgia" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Nostalgia</span></a></p>
