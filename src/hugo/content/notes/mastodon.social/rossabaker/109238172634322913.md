<p>Thoughts in the quiet before the migration of the birds:</p><p>I&#39;m working on spinning up a <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/blog" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>blog</span></a>.  Big Algorithm has damaged my attention span, and I hope to restore it through longer form reading and writing.  <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/indieweb" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>indieweb</span></a> concepts are resonating with me.</p>
