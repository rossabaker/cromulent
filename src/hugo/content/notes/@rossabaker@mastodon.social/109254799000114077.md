<p>I admire the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/CW" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>CW</span></a> tradition here.  It&#39;s a fair compromise between saying what needs to be said and not turning this into a doomscrollery for others.</p><p>Now I must avoid trivializing it by putting one on the score of the soccer game I coached today.</p>
