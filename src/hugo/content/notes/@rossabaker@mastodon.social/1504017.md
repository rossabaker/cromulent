<p>I can&#39;t talk about the monoids or the sportsballs without boring the other half of my following, so I reply far more than I tweet. But separate accounts means no serendipitously stumbling across other shared interests. Twitter offers no good solution. Mastodon&#39;s improvement is that my tale of woe fits into one toot.</p>
