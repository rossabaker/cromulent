      <description>In the Avian Period of social media, we had a late December tradition of enumerating the coding languages we used over the last year. Some people would aggregate them into a language ranking, which I never cared for. However, I thought they were great as a recommendation engine while browing specific developers.&#xA;Without further ado, my #code2023.&#xA;Languages used in 2023 # Awk Part of the old fart&amp;rsquo;s command line toolbox.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of those paint and sip classes. You get to try something new and have fun with your friends, and both of those are great, but the end product looks a lot like everyone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <title>Build your vocabulary with Scala affixes</title>
      <link>https://rossabaker.com/blog/scala-affixes/</link>

      <description>A powerful way to build one&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary is to study prefixes and suffixes. In elementary school, we learn that bi- means two. We can see it in common words like bicycle and bilingual. As we progress through school into binomials and bivalence, we&amp;rsquo;re ready. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect: is biennial twice a year or once every two years? Biryani isn&amp;rsquo;t two helpings of ryani. Still, they are surely worth studying.&#xA;A colleague in our Scala study group asked, &amp;ldquo;Can we do the same with Scala?</description>

      <title>Ox. Hugo. Why not both?</title>

      <description>This site is built on a static site generator (SSG). They are a dime a dozen. I chose a less mainstream one, ox-hugo. After recently questioning that choice, I have new clarity on why it&amp;rsquo;s right for me.&#xA;The goal # I want to write and sometimes generate content in a markup language. The SSG generator should apply a template, create aggregate views (such as tags), and output a directory that can be served off a cloud CDN, self-hosted with open source like nginx, or even out of a local directory with a simple Rust binary.</description>

      <description>Updated &amp;lt;2022-11-02 Wed&amp;gt;: some edits for concision&#xA;The asteroid hurtling toward Twitter last week forced many of us to look back on our digital lives. I reflected on my mistakes with perfectionism and proprietorship, and am looking to Indieweb for solutions.&#xA;Portrait of 1990s geekery # Figure 1: Dinosaur fossil by Nigel Holt, licensed under CC BY 2.0&#xA;The Wayback Machine has preserved my juvenilia. The soft tissue is gone, but here is the skeleton of a twentieth-century personal web page, the author not yet twenty.</description>

      <description>&lt;aside&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother recently passed away.  A lightly edited version of&#xA;this was read at her memorial service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/aside&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grandma and I had a tradition of playing Scrabble.  We used her&#xA;vintage set.  It still had score pads with games featuring players&#xA;further up the family tree.  It was intimidating.  I feared I might&#xA;draw a &amp;ldquo;þ&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;æ&amp;rdquo;, just like Chaucer used to play.  But it was indeed&#xA;the Modern English Alphabet Edition.  True to her meticulous nature,&#xA;it retained all its original pieces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
