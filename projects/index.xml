      <description>Long ago, I stumbled across HyperTerminal on the family Windows 95 machine. I figured out how to dial into my mom-and-pop ISP with that, and had my first shell access on a multi-user machine. Magical. A friendly admin taught me a lot, including how to make a .plan on one of the great social networks of the day, Finger.&#xA;I can be fingered once again on Happy Net Box. Run this from your own shell:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manning.com/books/scalatra-in-action&#34;&gt;Scalatra in Action&lt;/a&gt; was written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://constructiveproof.com/&#34;&gt;Dave Hrycyszyn,&lt;/a&gt; Stefan Ollinger, and&#xA;me and covers the &lt;a href=&#34;https://scalatra.org/&#34;&gt;Scalatra micro-framework&lt;/a&gt; in depth.  Scalatra is a&#xA;port of Ruby&amp;rsquo;s Sinatra to Scala.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>An important Indieweb principle is to own your data. I tooted on mastodon.social sporadically for five years. The service is public, the protocol open, and the implementation open source. Still, it exists at the pleasure of its admins, with whom I have no contract.&#xA;After moving to another instance, I wanted to preserve my old content. We will use a technique called PESOS, or Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate to Own Site.</description>

      <title>Personal Weather Station</title>

      <description>I run an Ambient Weather WS-1400-IP weather station in the Castleton neighborhood of Indianapolis and share its public dashboard. The anemometer is not raised high enough for accuracy, but the rest is reasonably accurate.&#xA;I learned on 2022-09-06 that the Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport is now publishing METAR data. That airport is just a mile away, and certainly has a more credible weather station, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to compare to mine.</description>
