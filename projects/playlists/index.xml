      <description>Elvis Costello &amp;amp; The Imposters&amp;rsquo; The Delivery Man isn&amp;rsquo;t his most successful album, commercially nor critically, but it ranks among my all-time favorites. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter who else agrees, but I was delighted when none other than Tom Waits joined me in 2005.&#xA;I found myself discussing Emmylou Harris today on Mastodon, and the album came up. I recalled Waits&amp;rsquo; endorsement and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder what else I&amp;rsquo;d been missing, so I assembled a Spotify playlist.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a season ticket holder to the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. As much as I enjoy the genre, I&amp;rsquo;m far from an expert. Starting with the 2023-24 season, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make playlists in advance and try to be a bit more familiar with the pieces.&#xA;2023-2024 Classical Series # September 29, 2023 # Event, Spotify playlist&#xA;Beethoven: Egmont Overture, Op.84 Puts: Contact Prokofiev: Symphony No. 5 in B-flat Major, Op.100 October 6, 2023 # Event, Spotify playlist</description>

      <title>Big Ten Fight Songs</title>

      <description>I am a lifelong Midwesterner. Fight songs are a big deal in the Big Ten. I played the &amp;ldquo;Minnesota Rouser&amp;rdquo; in my high school band in Illinois. &amp;ldquo;Indiana Our Indiana&amp;rdquo; is objectively the best, as measured by the fact I have two degrees from there and zero degrees from anywhere else.&#xA;The conference isn&amp;rsquo;t as Midwestern as it used to be, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have the 9 10 11 13 17 other songs gathered to sing along with whenever someone scores on Purdue.</description>
