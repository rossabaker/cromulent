      <description>I run an Ambient Weather WS-1400-IP weather station in the Castleton neighborhood of Indianapolis and share its public dashboard. The anemometer is not raised high enough for accuracy, but the rest is reasonably accurate.&#xA;I learned on 2022-09-06 that the Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport is now publishing METAR data. That airport is just a mile away, and certainly has a more credible weather station, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to compare to mine.</description>
