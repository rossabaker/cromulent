      <description>&lt;aside&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother recently passed away.  A lightly edited version of&#xA;this was read at her memorial service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/aside&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grandma and I had a tradition of playing Scrabble.  We used her&#xA;vintage set.  It still had score pads with games featuring players&#xA;further up the family tree.  It was intimidating.  I feared I might&#xA;draw a &amp;ldquo;þ&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;æ&amp;rdquo;, just like Chaucer used to play.  But it was indeed&#xA;the Modern English Alphabet Edition.  True to her meticulous nature,&#xA;it retained all its original pieces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
